        During the BCG Consulting Competition, our team of four worked on a case study for Viora, a clothing company facing challenges in choosing new markets for expansionâ€”both geographically and in target demographics. We conducted financial analysis, market sizing, and market research to develop accurate and efficient recommendations for their expansion strategy.

Our aim was to provide Viora with actionable insights to help them make informed decisions about entering markets with high growth potential, ultimately contributing to their success in new regions.
